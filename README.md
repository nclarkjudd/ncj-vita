This is my vita template. It relies on the `vc` tex package, which is public domain. The necessary files are included in the repository.

It also relies on the ETBembo font, which was renamed to ETBook.

The TeX file for my CV is also included as an example.

The CV template --- and the idea of sharing the template --- are both inspired by [Kieran Healy's example](https://github.com/nclarkjudd/ncj-vita).
